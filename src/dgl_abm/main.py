"""
DGL-ABM module for running an agent-based model using the deep-graph library (DGL)

This is the main function that simulates the time-stepping of the model using the following sub-functions:
    - initialize_model - initializes the agent as nodes in DGL along with agent properties
    - network_creation - Creates the network between the initialized nodes using edges from DGL
    - step - time-stepping for the poverty-trap model
    - local_attachment - Creates links between agents with "neighbor of a neighbor" approach
    - link_deletion - Randomly deletes links between agents
    - global_attachment - randomly connects different agents
    - agent_update - Updates the state of the agent based on income generation and money trades
    - model_output - Store and output model results/time-series
